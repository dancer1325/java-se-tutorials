* goal
  * where & how to use annotations | program
  * built-in annotations | Java SE API
  * how to 
    * implement repeating annotations
    * use type annotations + pluggable type systems

* == metadata -- about a -- program / != program itself
* ⚠️NO direct effect | operation of the code / they annotate ⚠️
* use cases
  * information | compiler
    * -- to detect -- errors OR suppress warnings
  * compile-time & deployment-time processing
    * -- to generate -- code, XML files
  * runtime processing
    * == be examined | runtime
  * replace code's comments
