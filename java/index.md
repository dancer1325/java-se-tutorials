<p><a href="nutsandbolts/index.html"><img src="../images/javaIcon.gif" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="trail icon" /> <b>Language Basics</b></a> describes the traditional features of the language, including variables, arrays, data types, operators, and control flow. <!--    JAVA OO    --></p>
<p><a href="javaOO/index.html"><img src="../images/javaIcon.gif" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="trail icon" /> <b>Classes and Objects</b></a> describes how to write the classes from which objects are created, and how to create and use the objects. <!--    JAVA IandI    --></p>

* [Annotations](annotations)

<p><a href="IandI/index.html"><img src="../images/javaIcon.gif" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="trail icon" /> <b>Interfaces and Inheritance</b></a> describes interfaces&#151;what they are, why you would want to write one, and how to write one. This section also describes the way in which you can derive one class from another. That is, how a <i>subclass</i> can inherit fields and methods from a <i>superclass</i>. You will learn that all classes are derived from the <code>Object</code> class, and how to modify the methods that a subclass inherits from superclasses. <!--    DATA    --></p>
<p><a href="data/index.html"><img src="../images/javaIcon.gif" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="trail icon" /> <b>Numbers and Strings</b></a> This lesson describes how to use <code>Number</code> and <code>String</code> objects The lesson also shows you how to format data for output. <!--    GENERICS    --></p>
<p><a href="generics/index.html"><img src="../images/javaIcon.gif" align="left" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="trail icon" /> <b>Generics</b></a> are a powerful feature of the Java programming language. They improve the type safety of your code, making more of your bugs detectable at compile time
